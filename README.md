# About the design
Designers thoughts on design decisions for the landing page to the upcoming movie Welcome To Mars. We have made three mockup views for mobile, tablet and desktop. The look and feel of the page should be similar on all three views but elements can shift for better and more efficient use of space and make a better user experience.

Mockups are made in Figma where we have two separate pages. One for components that are used in the design templates and one for the different views. As it's a small page we deemed it easier for the developer to overview if all three views were located in the same page.

Color selection…

Our choosing of fonts for logo, headings and paragraphs…

The header are fixed to the page top so visitors always have easy access to navigation.

The main menu for navigating the page will have to change depending on the visitors screen size. Therefore we designed a menu with visible links for the desktop view located in the header element. Then for tablet and mobile view we added a hamburger icon located in the header element to open the menu in a separate element on top of the page.

We designed a slider to display three cards and a slider navigation with arrows and dots. If a visitor clicks the arrows the card shifts to the next in order and the dots indicate what card is currently active.

Cookie box are fixed to the viewport bottom until clicked then it disappears.
